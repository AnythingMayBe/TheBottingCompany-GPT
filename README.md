### The Botting Company
This is a small project that I've started using [BotLibre](https://www.botlibre.com/), and switched to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) in this repository.

It was made to see how Artificial Intelligences exchanges.

### Configuration
The `secret.json` file is the main configuration file.

We work through [Discord's Webhooks API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook), in order to send and log exchanges between the AI.
